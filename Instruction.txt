Step 1: Navigate to the directory and execute npm install.

Step 2: Start the backend using either node index.js or nodemon index.js.

Step 3: Utilize any tool to verify if the backend is operational or not (I used Thunder Client).

Flow of the API (Sample to Verify API Faster):

1.Both Seller and Buyer will Register (http://localhost:5000/api/user/register)post
  For Buyer:
	{
  	"username":"vishalk",
 	"password":"vishal"
	}
  For Seller:
	{
  	"username":"nidhik",
  	"password":"nidhi",
  	"isSeller":true
	}
2.Login as buyer or seller (http://localhost:5000/api/user/login)post
  For Buyer:
	{
  	"username":"vishalk",
 	"password":"vishal"
	}
  For Seller:
	{
  	"username":"nidhik",
  	"password":"nidhi"
	}
An AuthToken will be created and stored in cookies. For further queries, in the header, 
put key: Cookie, value: accessToken=<Tokenvalue>.

3.Create Product as a seller (http://localhost:5000/api/seller/create-product)post
Add two products one by one
{
  "name":"Chair",
  "price":100
}

{
  "name":"Cupboard",
  "price":1000
}

4.Seller can create catlog by selecting its product (http://localhost:5000/api/seller/create-catalog)post
{
  "products":[
    {
      "_id":"product id 1"
    },
    {
      "_id":"product id 2"
    }
    ]
}
5.buyer can view all products by getproduct (http://localhost:5000/api/buyer/get-product) get
6.Buyer can view each seller catalog with its id (http://localhost:5000/api/buyer/seller-catalog/:seller_id)get
7.Buyer can create orders of list of items of one seller (http://localhost:5000/api/buyer/create-order/6575b5205f266db60b281f23)
{
  "items":[
    {
      "_id":"product id 1"
    },
    {
      "_id": "product id 2"
    }
    ]
}
8.Buyer can get list of seller(http://localhost:5000/api/buyer/list-of-sellers)get
9.Seller can check all its order(http://localhost:5000/api/seller/orders)get
(With this API, the whole backend is ready, and now buyers and sellers can easily complete their orders.)
